          Your support goes beyond donations. With CascadeFund, you can help

          CascadeFund has maintainer's workflow features only. Subscribe when the app profile and 
          project pages are ready. You can still browse projects, see what maintainers want to 
          be spread out, and tell us your favorite project maintainers to join once launched. If they joined, 
          you can see their public posts in Discord.
