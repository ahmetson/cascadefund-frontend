        All activities, such as message replies, roadmap planning, issue
        readings are turned into quest tasks. Each task contributes to the
        collaborative rating. Unlike competitive rating, a collaborative rating
        reflects how you work with others and on which types of projects.
        Similarly, a project rating reflects what goals preferred by the
        community, what kind of people are working on it.

        In CascadeFund, all project management is reduced to just 10 minutes of

        multi-click actions are minimized, giving you more offline time, saving
        energy, and helping prevent burnout.
